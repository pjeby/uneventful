/**
 * This module provides helpers for creating *extensions*: a way of extending
 * objects with additional (possibly private) data or methods via a WeakMap.
 *
 * An extension property links a type of object (known as the "target") with a
 * specific type of extension, via a factory function or class.  When you use an
 * extension property for a specific target, the extension is automatically
 * created (via the factory) if it doesn't already exist.
 *
 * Extension properties and methods are created either by inheriting from the
 * {@link Ext} class, or by wrapping factory functions with {@link ext}() or
 * {@link method}().
 *
 * @module uneventful/ext

 * @experimental
 * @disableGroups
 * @summary Tools for extending objects with extra state and behavior, without
 * directly modifying them.

/**
 * Create an extension accessor function that returns a memoized
 * value for a given target object or function.
 *
 * (Memoization is done via WeakMap, so the cached extensions will be freed
 * automatically once the target is garbage-collected.)
 *
 * @template Target The type of target object that will be extended.  Both the
 * passed-in factory function and the returned accessor function will take a
 * parameter of this type, which must be an object or function type.  (So it's
 * suitable for weak referencing.)
 *
 * @template ExtType The type of extension that will be cached.  Both the
 * passed-in factory function and the returned accessor will return a value of
 * this type.
 *
 * @param factory Function called with a target object or function and a weakmap
 * to create a new extension for that target.  The result is cached in the
 * weakmap so the factory is called at most once per target (unless you alter
 * the weakmap contents directly).
 *
 * @param map Optional: the weakmap to use to store the extensions.  This allows
 * you to manipulate the map contents (e.g. remove items or clear it) from
 * outside the factory function.  If no map is provided, one is created
 * automatically, but then it's only accessible via the factory function's
 * second parameter.
 *
 * @returns A function that always returns the same extension for a given target
 * (assuming you don't alter the WeakMap), calling the factory function if an
 * extension doesn't exist yet for that target.

/**
 * Create an extension *method*: a function that invokes a memoized closure for
 * a given target object or function.
 *
 * This function is almost identical to {@link ext}(), except that instead of an
 * accessor function, this returns a function that will *call* the extension
 * (method closure) corresponding to the target, passing along any extra
 * arguments.
 *
 * This is useful when you want to create an extension type that only has one
 * public method, and you'd rather not create a whole class for it: just set up
 * its state as variables in your factory function and return a closure. Then,
 * you can simply call `myMethod(target, ...args)`, which will look up the
 * (possibly cached) closure for `target` and call it with `(...args)`.  (You
 * could do the same thing with an {@link ext}() accessor, but then the API
 * would be `myMethod(target)(...args)`.)
 *
 * @template Target The type of target object that will be extended.  Both the
 * passed-in factory function and the returned accessor function will take a
 * parameter of this type, which must be an object or function type.  (So it's
 * suitable for weak referencing.)
 *
 * @template Method The type of the closure that will be cached.  The passed-in
 * factory function must return a value of this type, and the resulting wrapper
 * function will be of the same type but with an added initial `target`
 * parameter.  (Note: if this type has more than one call signature, only the
 * *last* overload will be used in the resulting method signature, due to
 * TypeScript compiler limitations.)
 *
 * @param factory Function called with a target object or function and a weakmap
 * to create a method closure for that target.  The result is cached in the
 * weakmap so the factory is called at most once per target (unless you alter
 * the weakmap contents directly).
 *
 * @param map Optional: the weakmap to use to store the method closures.  This
 * allows you to manipulate the map contents (e.g. remove items or clear it)
 * from outside the factory function.  If no map is provided, one is created
 * automatically, but then it's only accessible via the factory function's
 * second parameter.
 *
 * @returns A wrapper function that always invokes the same closure for a given
 * target (assuming you don't alter the WeakMap), calling the factory function
 * if a method closure doesn't exist yet for that target.  When called, the
 * wrapper function returns the result of calling the closure with the same
 * arguments (minus an initial `target` argument).
