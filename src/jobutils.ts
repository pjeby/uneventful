 * Start a nested job within the currently-active job.  (Shorthand for

 *
 * This function can be called with zero, one, or two arguments:
 *
 * - When called with zero arguments, the new job is returned without any other
 *   initialization.
 *
 * - When called with one argument that's a function (either a {@link SyncStart}
 *   or {@link AsyncStart}): the function is run inside the new job and receives
 *   it as an argument.  It can return a {@link Yielding} iterator (such as a
 *   generator or job), a promise, or void.  A returned iterator or promise will
 *   be treated as if the method was called with that to begin with; a returned
 *   job will be awaited and its result transferred to the new job
 *   asynchronously.  A returned function will be added to the job via `must()`.
 *
 * - When called with one argument that's a {@link Yielding} iterator (such as a
 *   generator or an existing job): it's attached to the new job and executed
 *   asynchronously. (Starting in the next available microtask.)
 *
 * - When called with one argument that's a Promise, it's converted to a job
 *   that will end when the promise settles.  The resulting job is returned.
 *
 * - When called with two arguments -- a "this" object and a function -- it
 *   works the same as one argument that's a function, except the function is
 *   bound to the supplied "this" before being called.
 *
 *   This last signature is needed because you can't make generator arrows in JS
 *   yet: if you want to start() a generator function bound to the current
 *   `this`, you'll want to use `.start(this, function*() { ...whatever  })`.
 *
 *   (Note, however, that TypeScript and/or VSCode may require that you give
 *   such a function an explicit `this` parameter (e.g. `.start(this, function
 *   *(this) {...}));`) in order to correctly infer types inside a generator
 *   function.)
 *
 * In any of the above cases, if a supplied function throws an error while
 * starting, the new job will be ended, and the error synchronously re-thrown.

/**
 * Wrap an argument-taking function so it will run in (and returns) a new Job
 * when called.
 *
 * This lets you avoid the common pattern of needing to write your functions or
 * methods like this:
 *
 * ```ts
 * function outer(arg1, arg2) {
 *     return start(function*() {
 *         // ...
 *     })
 * }
 * ```
 * and instead write them like this:
 * ```ts
 * const outer = task(function *(arg1, arg2) {
 *     // ...
 * });
 * ```
 * or this:
 * ```ts
 * class Something {
 *     ⁣⁣@task  // auto-detects TC39 or legacy decorators
 *     *someMethod(arg1): Yielding<SomeResultType> {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Important: if the wrapped function or method has overloads, the resulting
 * function type will be based on the **last** overload, because TypeScript (at
 * least as of 5.x) is still not very good at dealing with higher order
 * generics, especially if overloads are involved.
 *
 * Also note that TypeScript doesn't allow decorators to change the calling
 * signature or return type of a method, so even though the above method will
 * return a {@link Job}, TypeScript will only see it as a {@link Yielding}.
 *
 * This is fine if all you're going to do is `yield *` it to wait for the
 * result, but if you need to use any job-specific methods on it, you'll have to
 * pass it through {@link start} to have TypeScript treat it as an actual job.
 * (Luckily, start() has a fast path to return the original job if it's passed a
 * job, so you won't actually create a new job by doing this.)
 *
 * @param fn The function to wrap. A function returning a generator or
 * promise-like object (i.e., a {@link StartObj}).
 *
 * @returns A wrapped version of the function that passes through its arguments
 * to the original function, while running it in a new job.  (The wrapper also
 * returns the job.)
